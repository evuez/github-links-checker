# GitHub links checker
A little bot that looks for broken links in your READMEs.

## Installation

Requires Python >= 3.4

```
git clone git@github.com:evuez/github-links-checker.git
cd github-links-checker/
pip install -r requirements.txt
python github-links-checker.py
```

## Why?

I just don't like broken links.

At first I wanted to submit issues directly to repositories, but I think it's kinda spammy.

## WTF?

If you just got a mention from an issue in this repository, just remove that broken link from your README. You can then gently ask me to close this issue. Or I'll make another bot to make sure you did your work, cause I might be a bit too lazy to check all these issues.

## Your code is pretty awful, can I do something about it?

Fork, commit and PR, you know the drill.
