# GitHub links checker
A little bot that looks for broken links in your READMEs.

## Installation

Requires Python >= 3.4

```
git clone git@github.com:evuez/github-links-checker.git
cd github-links-checker/
pip install -r requirements.txt
python github-links-checker.py
```

## Why?

I just don't like broken links.

At first I wanted to submit issues directly to repositories, but I think it's kinda spammy.

## WTF?

If you just got a mention from an issue in this repository, just remove that f*ing broken link from your README. You can then gently ask me to close this issue. Or I'll make another bot to make sure you did your work, cause I might be a bit too lazy to check all these issues.

## Your code is pretty awful, can I do something about it?

Fork, commit and PR, you know the drill.
